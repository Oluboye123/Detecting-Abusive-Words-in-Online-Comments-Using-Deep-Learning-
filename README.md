# 🔍 Detecting Abusive Words in Online Comments Using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning** to classify and detect **toxic or abusive language** in online comments. The rise of **internet communication** has increased issues like **online harassment, bullying, and personal attacks**. Our goal is to develop a **Deep Learning-based classifier** that identifies and categorizes inappropriate content, helping online platforms maintain safer environments.

## 🧐 Problem Statement  
With the volume of online user-generated content, moderating conversations has become challenging. Manual review is **inefficient**, making **AI-driven automated moderation** crucial. However, detecting toxicity in language presents challenges such as:  
- **Sarcasm & Irony**: Indirect toxic comments that are difficult to detect.  
- **Ambiguity & Contextual Meaning**: Words can have multiple interpretations.  
- **Colloquialisms & Slang**: Evolving language makes toxicity detection harder.  
- **Spelling & Typing Errors**: Abusive content may be intentionally misspelled.  
- **Domain-Specific Language**: Toxicity varies across platforms (e.g., social media vs. gaming forums).

## 🚀 Key Challenges  
✔ **Handling Synonyms & Contextual Variability**  
✔ **Understanding Irony, Sarcasm, & Implicit Toxicity**  
✔ **Mitigating Bias in AI Models**  
✔ **Ensuring Fairness & Ethical Use of AI in Moderation**

## 📊 Results & Model Evaluation  
| Model | Accuracy (%) | F1-Score | Precision | Recall |
|--------|------------|---------|----------|--------|
| **LSTM** | 88.5% | 0.86 | 0.85 | 0.88 |
| **BiLSTM** | 90.1% | 0.89 | 0.87 | 0.90 |
| **CNN** | 86.3% | 0.84 | 0.83 | 0.86 |
| **BERT** | **94.7%** | **0.93** | **0.94** | **0.92** |
| **RoBERTa** | **95.2%** | **0.94** | **0.95** | **0.94** |

✅ **RoBERTa outperformed all models, achieving 95.2% accuracy.**  
✅ **BERT also performed well with 94.7% accuracy.**  
✅ **Traditional NLP models (CNN, LSTM) were slightly less effective.**
